"""backend.events.schemas — canonical event type constants and payload shapes.

ONE place to define every event ``type`` string used across the runtime:
  - orchestrator (orchestrator/main.py)
  - background workers (backend/api.py)
  - simulation layer (simulation/)
  - WebSocket stream (api/ws.py, core/stream.py)
  - frontend (frontend/src/types/index.ts)

Consumers must switch on these constants, not raw strings.
Publishers must set ``event["type"] = <CONSTANT>`` before calling stream.publish().

Backward-compatible aliases are provided for the legacy short-form names
("tick", "worker", "snapshot", "task_inventory") so the existing frontend
continues to work without changes.
